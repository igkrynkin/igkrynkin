### About me:

I became interested in Frontend development back in 2010, and took a number of video courses on creating websites using HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery/CMS Joomla, taught by the then famous Evgeniy Popov.
In the same year, 2010, I created the first commercial website using HTML/CSS and uploaded it to hosting; later I made several more websites using the same technology, but with the request of customers to expand the functionality of the websites created by many, I realized that I did not have enough knowledge for this and This is why I entered the ‚ÄúStep‚Äù Computer Academy; during my studies, I also managed to create several commercial projects on CMS Joomla (information portal and online store).

In 2013-2014, in a large company selling wallpaper and building materials, he worked as a Content Manager in CMS 1C-Bitrix + SEO and Photoshop
In 2016, I created a commercial website using CMS WordPress + SEO + design + support
In 2018, he created a commercial website using CMS OpenCart
In 2020, I created a commercial website on WordPress + SEO + design

Since all this time creating websites was more of a hobby of mine than a means of earning money, I simultaneously worked as a system administrator, a network engineer, and at the moment I am working as a system integration engineer, but the urge to create websites or applications has not gone away and that‚Äôs why I realized that it was mine. After a pause, I began to study current technologies for today, putting CMS aside and at the moment I can:

Work with Flexbox and Grid;
Understanding of the OOP programming paradigm;
I work with the Git version control system;
Layout the website, make it adaptive and cross-browser compatible;
Currently in the process of learning the depths of JavaScript and React.
